fare-puzzles
============

This is a collection of my solutions to various puzzles and exercises, in Common Lisp.
Over the years, I've come across these puzzles and exercises or been asked to solve them
by various friends, family members or potential employers. I made a repository for them,
to share with friends and family members, and to make it easier to reuse code infrastructure
between exercises.

Contents:

* [data/](data/) contains a corpus of data imported from other sites for use with some algorithms.
